# 🚀 Learning Django – My Web Development Journey  

Welcome to **Learning Django**! 🎯 This repository is my personal learning space where I document my progress, experiments, and projects while exploring Django – the powerful Python web framework.  

Whether you're also starting out with Django or just curious about web development, feel free to explore, learn, and grow with me!  

## 📌 What’s Inside?  

✅ **Basic Django Setup** – Installing Django, creating projects, and running the server.  
✅ **Django Fundamentals** – Understanding models, views, templates, and the MVT architecture.  
✅ **Database & ORM** – Working with databases using Django’s ORM (without writing raw SQL).  
✅ **Authentication** – Setting up login, logout, and user management.  
✅ **Building Simple Projects** – Hands-on mini-projects to reinforce learning.  

I'll be updating this repo as I progress, so stay tuned for more! 🚀
